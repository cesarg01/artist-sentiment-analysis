# Artist Sentiment Analysis
---------------------------
---------------------------

Python program that will allow the user to input the artist or band they want to see and check where they will be playing.

## Updates
There is a graph not showing up issue when searching for artists who have 10+ songs in their albums. This issue could be fixed by
using the Fetch function in main.js file. Another possible fix is using Threads to speed up the web scraping process.
